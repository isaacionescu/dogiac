	Natural born leaders like those born under the Aries sign deserve a dog who’s just as intelligent, fearless, and full of energy as they are. German Shepherds are often used as police dogs thanks to their loyalty and bravery. This energetic, highly trainable breed is ideal for a fire sign like Aries.

	2: `
	Any Taurus appreciates the beauty in life and will naturally gravitate toward the prettiest breeds. With his beautiful blonde coat and fetching doggy features, a golden retriever is an ideal pup to fit into a Taurus’ picture-perfect lifestyle. It doesn’t hurt that goldens are also loyal, dependable, and sociable — just like a Taurus.

	3: `
	It should go without saying that the sign of the Twins will need to get two of whichever breed they choose, which is why small-statured corgis make such an excellent option. Like their Gemini owners, corgis are affectionate, smart, and sociable, plus they adore being the center of attention. It’s a twin match made in heaven.

	4: `
	Cancers tend to become insecure if they’re not constantly cuddled, kissed, and told how special they are. Pomeranians understand that need and would love nothing more than to be included in the lovefest. They don’t need a lot of exercise, which is perfect for their homebody Cancer owners who would rather curl up in the house and relax.
	`,

	5: `
	Confident, courageous, and playful, Rottweilers have a lot in common with Leos. Both pet and owner are natural born leaders who love being loved and showing affection. Well-trained Rotties are fiercely loyal and protective toward their families, but they’re also just big, sweet lap dogs at heart.
	`,

	6: `
	Virgos are cool, calm, and calculated, and they don’t mind spending a lot of time alone. An energetic or needy breed wouldn’t be a good fit — but a refined, slightly aloof Chow Chow is just right. Chow Chows are reserved with strangers and loving toward family members, which a Virgo can certainly relate to.
	`,

	7: `
	Order, balance, harmony, and peace are all guiding principles for a Libra. They’re also likely to run marathons, making them the ideal companion for a swift and agile greyhound. A greyhound’s stature and personality will both appeal to the Libra owner.
	`,

	8: `
	A Scorpio is known for being slightly feisty and unafraid to try new things. Looking for a canine friend who can keep up? Check out the small yet mighty Norfolk terrier, who is equally fearless and fun-loving. They’ll be up for any kind of adventure and have a good attitude while doing it.
	`,

	9: `
	Forget boring routines — a Sagittarius wants to travel and discover new things, so they’ll need a breed who wants to explore the world together. Sagittarians also value intelligence, making them a perfect match for the smart and wily Australian shepherd. Closely associated with ranches and cowboys, they’ll be up for any kind of rodeo.
	`,

	10: `
	A driven, meticulous Capricorn deserves an equally tireless companion who recognizes the value of a hard day’s work. The St. Bernard is one of the world’s most famous and beloved breeds for good reason. He’s playful, charming, inquisitive, and one of the hardest working dogs you can choose.
	`,

	11: `
	At the end of the day, don’t you want a dog who’s just like you? A cavalier King Charles is small in stature and big in personality. Like any true Aquarius, he’s endlessly adaptable plus affectionate, graceful, and gentle. They’re also happy to interact with strangers and tend to give people the benefit of the doubt — true Aquarian traits.
	`,

	12: `
	A Pisces person is one of the most introspective and creative signs in the zodiac. They’re often misunderstood, just like their ideal companion dog, the poodle. Poodles are highly intelligent and trainable. While some may see them as prissy, in reality they have a lot to offer beneath those fluffy coats.
